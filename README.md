    * Contact Information (Make it easy for them to reach out)
    * Education Background (Show off your academic achievements)
    * Work Experience (Highlight your professional journey)
    * Projects (Showcase your creations and problem-solving skills)
    * Skills (Optional - Include this if you want to emphasize specific skills)
* Responsive design - Looks great on any device (desktop, mobile, tablet)
* Easy navigation - Find what you're looking for with a smooth-scrolling navigation bar
* Interactive elements (JavaScript and jQuery) -  I can add some cool features here (your choice!)
* Clean and readable formatting - Key information stands out!

**Technologies Used:**

* HTML5: Builds the structure and content of each web page.
* CSS3: Styles the website for a visually appealing and organized layout.
* JavaScript: Makes the website interactive and adds cool features.
* jQuery (Optional): Simplifies common JavaScript tasks (if you choose to use it).

**Getting Started:**

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. Boom! There's your online CV.

**Make it Yours!**

* Modify the CSS styles in the `style.css` file to create a unique design that reflects your personality.
* Play around with the JavaScript files (`script.js` or similar) to add your own interactive features. Remember to link them properly in the HTML.
